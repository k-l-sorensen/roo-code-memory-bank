        <thinking>
        I will read all memory bank files, one at a time, using the correct paths.
        </thinking>
        Plan: Read all mandatory files sequentially.
        1. Check for and read `projectBrief.md` in the root directory if it exists
        2. Read `memory-bank/productContext.md`
        3. Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md` 
        4. Read `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` 
        5. Read `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` 
        6. Read `memory-bank/progress.md` 
        7. Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] and inform user.
        8. Proceed with the code_workflow below with Memory Bank context.

# This is where we integrate the special instructions for Orchestrator mode
orchestrator_workflow: |
  After checking for the Memory Bank and reading files if available, follow these orchestration steps:
  
  1. **Task Decomposition:**
     - When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks
     - If Memory Bank is active:
       a. Review memory-bank/productContext.md to ensure alignment with project goals
       b. Check memory-bank/activeContext.md for current focus areas
       c. Review previous task breakdowns in memory-bank/progress.md for consistency
     - Document the task breakdown plan in memory-bank/progress.md before implementation
  
  2. **Subtask Delegation:**
     - For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate to appropriate specialized modes
     - Include in the `message` parameter:
       a. All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks
       b. A clearly defined scope of what the subtask should accomplish
       c. An explicit statement that the subtask should only perform the work outlined
       d. Instructions to signal completion using `attempt_completion` with a summary in the `result` parameter
       e. A statement that these specific instructions supersede conflicting general instructions
     - If Memory Bank is active, document each delegation in memory-bank/decisionLog.md with:
       a. The subtask name and assigned mode
       b. Rationale for mode selection
       c. Expected deliverables and dependencies
  
  3. **Subtask Tracking:**
     - Track and manage the progress of all subtasks
     - When a subtask is completed:
       a. Analyze its results
       b. Determine next steps
       c. Update memory-bank/progress.md with completion status and key outcomes
     - Maintain a master task list in the Memory Bank that shows the status of all subtasks
  
  4. **Workflow Transparency:**
     - Help the user understand how subtasks fit together in the workflow
     - Provide clear reasoning about task delegation decisions
     - Reference the Memory Bank to show the overall project context and how current tasks relate
     - Visualize task dependencies and workflows when helpful
  
  5. **Results Synthesis:**
     - When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results
     - Provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished
     - Update all relevant Memory Bank files with the final outcomes
  
  6. **Length Awareness:**
     - After updating any Memory Bank files, check if they exceed recommended limits:
       a. memory-bank/progress.md should contain only the 20 most recent tasks
       b. Other Memory Bank files should remain under 2,000 words
     - If limits are exceeded, alert the user and suggest switching to Architect mode
     - Do NOT attempt to move content to the docs/ folder or reorganize the Memory Bank
     - Consider including Memory Bank maintenance as a subtask for Architect mode

  documentation_management: |
    Architect mode is responsible for all documentation management and maintaining length limits.
    Orchestrator mode should not attempt to move content to docs/ folder or reorganize Memory Bank files.
    If Memory Bank files exceed recommended limits after your updates, alert the user and suggest:
    1. Switching to Architect mode for Memory Bank maintenance, or
    2. Including Memory Bank maintenance as a specific subtask for Architect mode
